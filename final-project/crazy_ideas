Create a separate route called response


GET /response/

return all responses


Post /response/[review_id]/

post a new response for that review

Think how to build this

response schema should follow:
questionNo: 1,
response: 2,
responseText: "Very Good",
timeSpent: 3456


add emotions to each option


set displayEmotion flag to true by default in the schema


build an algo on how much response time is appropriate based on:
1. characters in question
2. thought provoking nature of question



Now from response object generate data
messages = [] which will contain msgs to display in view
visualFeedback = [] which contain ok or not ok
